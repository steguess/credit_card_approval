# Credit Card Approval Predictor

![Credit Card Image](creditcard.png)

Welcome to the Credit Card Approval Predictor project! In this machine learning project, you will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like commercial banks do.

## Project Description üìö

Commercial banks receive numerous credit card applications, and the manual analysis of these applications is time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to automate the credit card approval process using machine learning. The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Tasks üìù

1. **Credit Card Applications**: Introduction to the credit card approval dataset.
2. **Inspecting the Applications**: Exploratory data analysis and data understanding.
3. **Splitting the Dataset**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. **Handling Missing Values (Part I)**: Addressing missing data in the dataset.
5. **Handling Missing Values (Part II)**: Continued handling of missing data.
6. **Handling Missing Values (Part III)**: Completing missing data treatment.
7. **Preprocessing the Data (Part I)**: Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
8. **Preprocessing the Data (Part II)**: Further data preprocessing steps.
9. **Fitting a Logistic Regression Model**: Building a logistic regression model for credit card approval prediction.
10. **Making Predictions and Evaluating Performance**: Model evaluation and predictions.
11. **Grid Searching and Model Optimization**: Fine-tuning the model for better performance.
12. **Finding the Best Performing Model**: Identifying the best-performing model for credit card approval prediction.

## Notebook Highlights üöÄ

This notebook covers a range of machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, logistic regression modeling, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. It provides a step-by-step guide to building an automatic credit card approval predictor.
